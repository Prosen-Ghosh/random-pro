area between imperative and functional languages.The fact that they’re able to be so streamlined gets right to the heart of OOP logic.In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x will produce the same result f(x) each time; this is in contrast to procedures depending on a local or global state, which may produce different results at different times when called with the same arguments but a different program state.As soon as possible.Imperative programming does have functions—not in the mathematical sense—but in the sense of subroutines.We don’t need to understand all of its internal mechanics, what kind of engine it has, how the gas makes it run, or even where the gas came from in order to know how to interact with it.In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.The Julia language also offers functional programming abilities.Modern, high-level languages like Python and Ruby are perfect examples of OOP.

### Generate Token

***generateToken(bit,prefix)*** This function will generate token. If prefix is present then it will add prefix and a dash `-` to the token. By default generateTiken() function generate 32 bit token.

```javascript
var rand = require('random-pro');
console.log(rand.generateToken());
// 2Zv32Kke
console.log(rand.generateToken(64));
// m6jpyBHz4ld8CN#L
console.log(rand.generateToken(64,"PRO"));
// PRO-YYq4W/+UAqDWmO6S
```
